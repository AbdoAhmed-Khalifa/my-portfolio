# Mobile Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented to fix mobile scrolling lag issues.

## Issues Identified

1. **Heavy 3D animations running continuously** - Multiple `useFrame` hooks and GSAP animations
2. **Scroll event listener without throttling** - Navbar scroll listener running on every scroll event
3. **Complex animations with framer-motion** - AnimatedText component with character-by-character animations
4. **Multiple heavy 3D models and textures** - HackerRoom, Cube, Rings, Target components running simultaneously
5. **No performance optimizations for mobile** - Same heavy animations on mobile as desktop

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. CSS Performance Optimizations (`src/index.css`)

- Added hardware acceleration with `transform: translateZ(0)`
- Enabled `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch` for smooth mobile scrolling
- Added `will-change: scroll-position` for better scroll performance
- Optimized canvas touch interactions with `touch-action: none`

### 2. Scroll Event Throttling (`src/sections/Navbar.tsx`)

- Implemented throttled scroll event listener (16ms for desktop, 32ms for mobile)
- Added `passive: true` to scroll event listeners
- Used `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders

### 3. Mobile-Specific Animation Optimizations

#### AnimatedText Component (`src/components/AnimatedText.tsx`)

- Simplified animations on mobile (no character-by-character animation)
- Disabled text cycling on mobile
- Reduced animation duration on mobile devices

#### 3D Components Optimization

- **HeroCamera**: Reduced damping and disabled pointer tracking on mobile
- **Cube**: Simplified rotation animations and reduced scale on mobile
- **Rings**: Reduced number of rings (2 instead of 4) and simplified animations
- **Target**: Reduced animation intensity and scale on mobile

### 4. Canvas Performance Optimizations (`src/sections/Hero.tsx`)

- Reduced device pixel ratio (DPR) to 1 on mobile
- Disabled antialiasing on mobile
- Set `powerPreference: 'high-performance'`
- Disabled alpha channel for better performance

### 5. HTML Meta Tags (`index.html`)

- Added mobile web app capable meta tags
- Disabled user scaling for better performance
- Added format detection prevention

### 6. Performance Hook (`src/hooks/usePerformance.ts`)

- Centralized performance configuration
- Mobile detection utilities
- Configurable animation settings based on device

## Performance Improvements

### Before Optimization

- Scroll events firing at 60fps on mobile
- Complex 3D animations running continuously
- Character-by-character text animations
- No mobile-specific optimizations

### After Optimization

- Throttled scroll events (30fps on mobile)
- Simplified animations on mobile devices
- Reduced 3D model complexity on mobile
- Hardware-accelerated scrolling
- Mobile-specific performance configurations

## Testing

To test the optimizations:

1. **Mobile Device Testing**: Test on actual mobile devices, not just browser dev tools
2. **Scroll Performance**: Check for smooth scrolling without lag
3. **Animation Performance**: Verify animations don't cause frame drops
4. **Battery Impact**: Monitor battery usage during extended use

## Browser Support

These optimizations are designed to work on:

- iOS Safari (12+)
- Chrome Mobile (70+)
- Samsung Internet (10+)
- Firefox Mobile (68+)

## Future Optimizations

Consider implementing:

1. **Intersection Observer** for better scroll performance
2. **Web Workers** for heavy computations
3. **Service Worker** for caching
4. **Progressive loading** of 3D models
5. **Lazy loading** of non-critical components
